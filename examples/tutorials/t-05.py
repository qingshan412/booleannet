# The collector helper function
#
# Asynchronous updating rules are non deterministic and
# need to be averaged over many runs
#
# The collector class makes this averaging very easy. It takes
# a list of states and nodes to build a data structure that 
# can compute the average the state of each node over all simulation and each timestep.
#
# The output of averaging (in the normalized mode) is a value between
# 0 and 1 representing the fraction of simulation (multiply by 100 to get percent) 
# that had the node in state True.
